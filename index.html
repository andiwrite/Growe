            I used to think I was lost, but now I see I was just exploring. Every wrong turn was a lesson, a chapter in the story of becoming who I am. I am not defined by my past mistakes but by how I rise above them. My strength is not in perfection but in the courage to keep going, even when the road gets rough. My value isnâ€™t determined by others' approval but by the love I hold for myself. I am a work in progress, constantly evolving, growing, and becoming more of who I am meant to be. The journey is mine, and I am learning to cherish every step, every stumble, and every victory. In this moment, I choose to be gentle with myself, to honor my journey, and to trust that I am exactly where I need to be.
